--> Libraries Used :

1)  ollama :

 Python library used for interacting with AI models, particularly for natural language processing tasks.
 In the code, it will interact with the qwen2:0.5b model to generate a summary based on the provided text.

 2)  click:

It is a Python package used for creating command-line interfaces (CLIs).
In the code, Click is used to define a CLI command assignment, which accepts either a text input or a file path as an argument.
